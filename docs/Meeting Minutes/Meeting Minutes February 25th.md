# Meeting Minutes 2/25
**Team Leader: Arsal Hussain**

## Attendance:
* All members and professor were present





## updates: 
- Shared Software Architecture Diagram during meeting, expanding on use cases and potential integration
- Shared administration/hiring manager dashboard, still considering design/logo
- Shared potential algorithm that has been brainstormed

# Back End Notes
- Considerations for algorithm
- >consider returning graders first
  >consider their qualifications / majors
  >consider their resumes (namely course list)
  >Output can just be an excel file
- edge cases to consider: grader might decide not to take the job

# Front End Notes
- Link Figma to repository (within weekly reports can be an option)

# Professor Alagar Suggestions
- Do not focus too much on grader dashboard, won't be necessary
- Consider using SSO for logging in
- Only person using tool at the moment will be hiring manager, applications and information retrieved from handshake/pdf
- Think about authentication for the hiring manager (SSO, UN/PW?)
- Cloud storage won't be necessary, will be using MongoDB
- Generalize the architecture, allocate list of graders available
- Don't spend too much time on dashboard screens, can provide data, make it simple
- dashboard stats usability - what does the hiring manger want to see? which courses have graders, which courses dont? how many of each
- Can check coursebook or syllabus and retrieve keywords as potential parameters for matching
  >Is there an automated way to retrieve data on a semester by semester basis
# Thenn Suggestions


# Next Steps
- See the Figma and UI of different views
