## To Do List
- Frontend team will need to create a rough sketch and move to Figma
- Adjust rotation leader once confirmed via Thenn and Professor Alagar
- Create Architecture Design
- Would have access to course syllabus to know target keywords and compile for candidate resume
- Frontend team can work independently
- Backend team should start working on database, and matching algorithm, can use chatgpt for comparison
- Database: Will get shared CSV files for test cases
-- Contains candidates, resumes appended at bottom (will have to figure if resume is more than one page)
--XLSX file, [date student id first last name school year] (fully qualified means if they are part of same major) main concern is filtering out candidates with true qualifications, can use false candidates as reserve
-- Manually assignment can be useful when professor is viewing eligible candidates
- Professor and course list is sensitive data, can tailor that information to our liking (pull data manually)
- Work with UTD Virtual Machine (Linux)
- Full stack should consider implementation
- Starting assigning tasks individually on Git Projects

## Thenn suggestions
- Get a finalized design of the architecture design
- Split tasks on timeline (backend, frontend, full stack)
--   Columns should include each team, sprints
- Team Leader should be two consecutive weeks (will confirm with professor)
